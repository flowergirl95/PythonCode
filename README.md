# Instacart Basket Analysis Python

# Objective
Instacart already has very good sales, but they
 want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to
 perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
 to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
 the provided criteria

 # Key Questions
 - The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
 day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
 times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
 spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
 these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
 use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
 - Aretherecertain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
 and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
 product orders 
 - Themarketing andsales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
 customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
     - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
      often do they return to Instacart)?
    - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
    - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
    - Isthere aconnection between age and family status in terms of ordering
      habits?
      - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
     Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
    - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
      profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
      customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of
